# Infectious Disease Modeling

Notes and code as I teach myself Infectious Disease modeling from the ground up, using various textbooks and online resources.

I will link things where I can, and try to make my notes as explainable and accessible as possible. I have some previous experience with modeling, but even the very basics can be confusing and it's good to review.
